> Enhance your Redux store to support batched actions

[![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@manaflair/redux-batch.svg)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@manaflair/redux-batch.svg)]()

[Check out our other OSS projects!](https://manaflair.github.io)

## Installation

```
$> npm install --save @manaflair/redux-batch
```

## Usage

```js
import { reduxBatch }  from '@manaflair/redux-batch';
import { createStore } from 'redux';

let store = createStore(reducer, reduxBatch);

store.dispatch([

  // Store listeners will only be called once all of these actions
  // have been dispatched to the store.

  { type: `INCREMENT_COUNTER` },
  { type: `INCREMENT_COUNTER` },

]);
```

## Usage w/ extra middlewares

```js
import { reduxBatch }                            from '@manaflair/redux-batch';
import { put, takeEvery }                        from 'redux-saga/effects';
import createSagaMiddleware                      from 'redux-saga';
import { applyMiddleware, compose, createStore } from 'redux';

let sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();
let store = createStore(reducer, compose(reduxBatch, applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware), reduxBatch));

sagaMiddleware.run(function* () {
  yield takeEvery(`*`, function* (action) {

    // Duplicate any event dispatched, and once again, store
    // listeners will only be fired after both actions have
    // been resolved/

    yield [
      put(action),
      put(action),
    ]
  });
});
```

Notice how we duplicate the reduxBatch enhancer. We do this because we want our sagas to be able to emit batch actions as well. Without the first reduxBatch enhancer, any batch action emitted from our sagas would cascade into the standard dispatch method, and wouldn't get a chance to be flattened. Similarly, without the second one, any action dispatched wouldn't be flattened before being passed to our sagas, which wouldn't know how to deal with these curiously formed actions.

## Differences with other libraries

- [redux-batched-actions](https://github.com/tshelburne/redux-batched-actions) use a specific action type in order to support batched actions. It works fine, but unfortunately it's unpractical with enhancers, because they aren't aware of this action semantic, and won't flatten it (unless they add a specific support for this action type).

- [redux-batched-subscribe](https://github.com/tappleby/redux-batched-subscribe) features advanced mechanisms to defer notifying store listeners (for example by debouncing these notifications), but doesn't deal per-se with batch actions. We share a similar name, but a completely different purpose.

## Thanks

Most of this code has been originally designed by [Mark Erikson](https://github.com/markerikson) on the [following thread](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/pull/1813#issuecomment-227623481). We mainly packaged it into an easy-to-use module.
